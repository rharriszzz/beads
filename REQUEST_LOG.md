# Beads requests — photo-2-reconstruction-v2

Append-only. Earlier R001–R091 history is preserved at
photo-2-reconstruction `2c4c116bf7f7b9e8c773358a97740dcd77879a8a:REQUEST_LOG.md`.
This fresh branch is based on origin/master 020303e, not on that experiment branch.

## R092 — Restart photo-2 reconstruction, one aspect at a time (2026-09-27)

User request, verbatim:

> We are going to work in the "beads" directory, in a new branch off of the main branch.
> Our eventual goal is to extend beads.pov so that it can render a simulation of beads-photo-2.jpg.
> We will want to be able to render the magenta paper the necklace is on
> (however this should be done in a way that does not depend on the color of the background),
> we want to attempt to replicate the lighting,
> we will need a spline that replicates the way the necklace is physically arranged,
> we want to identify the beads color and material (use povray's definition for material),
> we want to identify the helicity of the necklace, and
> we will need to identify the pattern of beads (which hass pattern length of
> somewhere between 200 and 400).
> use povray and python.
> You can use ideas you find in any branch of these repos: beads fft-image-explorer bead_map hsv_tools.
> Use workflow ideas from the photo-2-reconstruction branch of the beads repo;
> these ideas had been developed first fot the navier-stokes-vortex-lab repo read this if you want.
> I want you to focus one aspect of the project at a time, then tell me which aspect,
> as well a presenting options for solving that aspect.  For example, suppose
> that the first thing to do is to distinguish the background from the foreground.
> In this case the background might be a piece of paper, and it includes all of the paper that is visible,
> even if it in the shadow of the necklace.  I want you to come up with 3 to 6 methods of doing
> this, and present it to me, and I will provide more if you are missing some.  I do want you to
> evaluate using a 2d fft, using a gaussian filter of radius 0.05 of the square root of the total number
> of pixels in the image as a starting point.  Interpreting the results is tricky, but it can tell you
> if point is entirely over the background versus entirely over the bracelet.  Also, once
> you know the centerline of the bracelet, this fft can tell you all three spacings (1,6,7) as well
> as the helicity, no mater where you sample along the centerline.  Again figuring out how to do
> this is tricky.  It is ok to not use ffts if it is too hard.
> Next, in order to come up with a good approximation to the lighting.
> There are specular reflections in many of the beads.  You might be able to find clues on how to
> reconstruct the lighting from the web.  Most likely the photo was taken by an iphone.
> Once you have the background and lighting, you may add them into beads.pov, if you
> think that it would be helpfil
> Next we need to determine the locations of some or most or all of the beads.  In general,
> there will be shadows at the edge of each bead, however if two beads are adjacent, one bead
> will be more in front of the other will occlude some or all if the part of the shadow of the
> bead that is behind.  Please try to be relatively color independent; I know that this is
> hard for black beads.  At each phase, please give me you list of possible implementation
> methods, so I can give you advice.  Also come up with questions, if you want.
> I did work on the photo-2-reconstruction branch for quite some time.

Preflight: daisy, clean photo-2-reconstruction at 2c4c116, no stashes, matching
remote branch tip. Remote default is master at 020303e; no main exists. Explained
the name substitution and selected photo-2-reconstruction-v2. Initial network
lookup failed in sandbox; escalated lookup/fetch succeeded. Read current handoff,
latest log, workflow, shape quick model/task rows, saved answers, methods overview,
branch-review notes and rejected R067 edge experiment. Read sibling FFT README
and window implementation; sibling branch untouched. No new status/usage,
delegation, account inspection or ownership transfer.

## R093 — More frequent illustrated review (2026-09-27)

User: “The a later edge-based correction was not very good, as the edges were to
so good, in particular, they had indents and bumps that should not have existed.
More frequent questions to me, with illustrations, migh help this problem.”

User interrupted the branch-creation tool call. Inspection confirmed no switch
had occurred. Save feedback as a contour-quality failure; do not treat it as
exact edge coordinates. Add small raw/candidate comparisons before propagating
outlines; separate broad rope shape from real bead-scale silhouette scallops.

## R094 — Resume unfinished first step (2026-09-27)

User: “continue”

Rechecked machine/status/stashes. Created photo-2-reconstruction-v2 directly from
origin/master with escalation for protected .git. Re-established ignores for
the existing local .venv, caches and generated output; preserved these files.
New branch workflow/plan/handoff reference historical evidence without importing
the experimental scene or previous masks. Python 3.12.14; POV-Ray installed.
No new dependencies installed. First task: five background-separation options,
small local FFT evaluation and illustrated questions, then stop for feedback.

## R095 — Smaller FFT windows near the boundary (2026-09-27)

User: “I agree, I am not sure a good way to do the boundary, perhaps increasing
smaller fft radius?”

Interpret as agreement to the proposed FFT/spatial-texture comparison and a
suggestion to progressively shrink windows near the transition. Saved wording
and explicit interpretation in QUESTIONS.md. Precise Gaussian semantics remain
pending; no exact edge or fully automatic boundary method was confirmed.
Next task now centers on an illustrated coarse-to-fine boundary experiment.

### R092–R095 outcome and checks

Five methods documented: Gaussian-window FFT, spatial multiscale texture,
learned paper/shading appearance, sparse-label region segmentation, and smooth
joint rope/contour geometry. Prefer first comparing the two texture cues with
reviewed labels. Paper includes cast shadow. No hard-coded magenta predicate.

Six locations × three scales = 18 probe spectra. Starting radius .05 sqrt(N)
is 142.146755 px, provisionally interpreted as sigma; alternatives sigma/3 and
sigma/6. Grayscale weighted-plane subtraction, Gaussian window, 2D FFT and a
fixed 1/64 cycles/pixel high-band metric. E/F near-shadow paper RMS falls from
.07175/.08437 to .01259/.01099 with smaller windows; small-window C/D necklace
RMS .16629/.19331. Hand-selected examples, not measured classification accuracy.
Broad C/D/E reflect photo edges. No contour, spline, inventory, helicity or
pattern inferred. Parameters, coordinates, source/code/image hashes in report.

The initial synthetic control's 20× fast/slow RMS criterion failed (actual 8.53×).
Finite-window spectral spreading crosses the chosen cutoff. Revised to 5× plus
>99% fast-wave and <5% slow-wave high-band energy. Five controls now pass;
this change is documented and does not validate photo segmentation. Matplotlib
initially warned about a nonwritable default cache; script uses /tmp cache.
EXIF read identifies LensModel iPhone 11 Pro back triple camera 4.25mm f/1.8;
lighting is not established by that metadata. No lighting web research yet.

Three curated illustrations inspected. Repeat artifacts verified byte-identical;
source/code/illustration hashes, table values, local links, Python compilation,
and whitespace checked. beads.pov and source photo match base commit. No render
or old pipeline suite needed for this bounded probe. Routine outputs and .venv
excluded. Scoped files to be committed/pushed; delivery verified after commit.

Next: progressively smaller FFT windows versus spatial texture along short,
explained transitions; show raw context, routes, scale disagreement and tentative
edge bands. Stop before whole-image contour/spline or scene changes. Carry forward
gpt-6-astra / High recommendation; stay in this conversation for focused feedback.

## R096 — Shadowed paper/bead HSV overlap (2026-09-27)

User: “The HSV values in the shadowed background seem to overlap the HSV values
in the shadowed part of the bracelet, it makes me sad.  I guess we just worrry
that much about it.”

Saved as maker-reported apparent overlap; no new HSV distribution measurement.
The last sentence is ambiguous, so no cancellation or requirement to resolve
every ambiguous pixel is inferred. Continue the agreed texture/context comparison;
HSV is optional supporting evidence, with uncertain edge bands where necessary.
Do not spend a phase forcing a perfect pixel-color threshold. Updated workflow,
method notes and handoff; no additional question needed for this clarification.

## R097 — Clarify original FFT background metric (2026-09-27)

User: “When I was doing the ffts to check for backgound, I filtered out the strong
peak at the center, and looked at how much power was left over.  very ad-hoc.
Maybe you can figure out a better way.”

Recorded central-peak rejection / remaining-power method. This partly clarifies
question 1 but not the Gaussian convention or exact exclusion radius. Explain
that the current probe uses a related central-disk exclusion after detrending.
Next compare DC-only versus finite central exclusion, absolute power and fractions
with explicit denominators, using paper controls and images of the excluded
frequencies. Current high_frequency_fraction uses detrended power; an original-
power denominator is a proposed additional comparison, not a computed result.
Small denominators can exaggerate noise; absolute power depends on brightness.
No validated superiority or boundary accuracy claimed. Updated question status,
method notes, plan and handoff; keep the first-step delivery boundary.

Final pre-delivery checks: 16 local documentation links resolve; all four repeat
artifacts are byte-identical; source/script/three image hashes match the report;
18 sample records verified; scene and photo equal the base commit; Python
compilation passes. Staged whitespace check caught a trailing blank line in the
new .gitignore, which was removed before commit. Only the 15 listed new-branch
files are staged; local environments, caches and routine output remain ignored.
